An architectural pattern is a general, reusable resolution to a commonly occurring problem 
in software architecture within a given context. The architectural patterns address various 
issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance limitations, high 
availability and minimization of a business risk. Some architectural patterns have been 
implemented within software frameworks.
