Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software design and development. They represent best practices and provide a way to structure code in a flexible and maintainable way. 

Structural Patterns:
Deal with the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures.
Examples include Adapter, Decorator, and Composite patterns.

Behavioral Patterns:
Define the ways in which objects interact and communicate with each other.
Examples include Observer, State, and Iterator patterns.
