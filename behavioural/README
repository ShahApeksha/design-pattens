Behavioural design patterns deal with the interaction of objects in an object-oriented 
software application. They provide a set of guidelines formulated by software pioneers that 
identify common communication pattern among objects and provide a way to solve 
commonly occurring object interaction related problems in software design.

Five well-known design patterns that are parts of behavioural patterns are the

1. Memento Design Pattern, which provides the ability to restore an object to its 
previous state (rollback).
2. Observer Design Pattern, a.k.a. Publish/Subscribe or Event Listener. Objects 
register to observe an event that may be raised by another object. Weak reference 
pattern: De-couple an observer from an observable.
3. Mediator Design Pattern, which provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces 
in a subsystem
4. State Design Pattern, which is a clean way for an object to partially change its type 
at runtime.
5. Iterator Design Pattern, Iterators are used to access the elements of an aggregate 
object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
